## What is Cabbage?
A cool tool which messes up a portion of your files' bytes, making them unreadable and unrecognizable by any usual software, but readable by Cabbage itself. This is useful when you're trying to hide your priceless chinese fart porn from your momma's eyes. 
Although this tool was made to withstand any low-level approach, person with high computer knowledge will eventually find a way to read the files. So, to further protect yourself, I recommend using Cabbage with, for example, an APFS-encrypted external drive.
## Why Cabbage?
- Lightning fast
- Tiny
- Easy to use
- Trustable (_read the code and build yourself_)
- Does the thing
- Makes your tummy feel yummy
