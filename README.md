## What is Cabbage?
A cool tool which __messes up__ a portion of __your images' bytes__, making them unreadable and __unrecognizable by any usual software__, but __readable by Cabbage__ itself. This is useful when you're trying to hide your priceless chinese fart porn from your momma's eyes.\
Although this tool was made to __withstand any low-level approach__, person with high computer knowledge will eventually find a way to read the files. So, to further protect yourself, I recommend using Cabbage with, for example, an APFS encrypted external drive.\
Cabbage can only really screw __image__ files, but it adds __additional file extension__ to all other file types, making them unknown to the system, thus uneasy to view.  
## Why Cabbage?
- Lightning fast
- Tiny
- Ridiculously easy to use
- Trustable (_read the code and build yourself_)
- Does its thing
- Makes your tummy feel yummy
## File info description
- `Deep-fried` means current file's bytes were modified, making it difficult to open even by a professional
- `Undercooked` means an additional extension was applied to the current file, without messing with its contents
- `Raw` means this file was not modified and may be viewed by both Cabbage and default viewer
