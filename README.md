## What is Cabbage?
A cool tool which __messes up__ a portion of __your files' bytes__, making them unreadable and __unrecognizable by any usual software__, but __readable by Cabbage__ itself. This is useful when you're trying to hide your priceless chinese fart porn from your momma's eyes.\
Although this tool was made to __withstand any low-level approach__, person with high computer knowledge will eventually find a way to read the files. So, to further protect yourself, I recommend using Cabbage with, for example, an APFS encrypted external drive.\ 
## Why Cabbage?
- Lightning fast
- Tiny
- Ridiculously easy to use
- Trustable (_read the code and build yourself_)
- Does its thing
- Makes your tummy feel yummy
